# metabolic_pathway_analysis
This repository was created in an effort to produce a pipeline that starts with raw RNA-seq reads and ends with an analysis of  differentially expressed genes in pathways. The pipeline was designed specifically for A. thaliana and its bacterial pathogens  but could, in theory, be applied to any RNA-seq analysis.
